## [TMDB] failed to retrieve/fetch XXX

### Option 1: Change your DNS servers

This error usually comes from your DNS servers not being able to resolve the hostname of the TMDB API, because your Internet Service Provider (ISP) is blocking it.

To fix this, you can change your DNS servers to a public DNS service like Google's DNS or Cloudflare's DNS:

<Tabs groupId="methods" queryString>
  <TabItem value="docker-cli" label="Docker CLI">

Add the following to your `docker run` command to use Google's DNS:
```bash
--dns=8.8.8.8
```
or for Cloudflare's DNS:
```bash
--dns=1.1.1.1
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">

Add the following to your `compose.yaml` to use Google's DNS:
```yaml
---
services:
  jellyseerr:
    dns:
      - 8.8.8.8
```
or for Cloudflare's DNS:
```yaml
---
services:
  jellyseerr:
    dns:
      - 1.1.1.1
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Click on Network and Internet.
3. Click on Network and Sharing Center.
4. Click on Change adapter settings.
5. Right-click the network interface connected to the internet and select Properties.
6. Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and click Properties.
7. Select Use the following DNS server addresses and enter `8.8.8.8` for Google's DNS or `1.1.1.1` for Cloudflare's DNS.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

1. Open a terminal.
2. Edit the `/etc/resolv.conf` file with your favorite text editor.
3. Add the following line to use Google's DNS:
    ```bash
    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    ```
    or for Cloudflare's DNS:

    ```bash
    nameserver 1.1.1.1
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Option 2: Force IPV4 resolution first

Sometimes there are configuration issues with IPV6 that prevent the hostname resolution from working correctly.

You can try to force the resolution to use IPV4 first by setting the `FORCE_IPV4_FIRST` environment variable to `true`:

<Tabs groupId="methods" queryString>
  <TabItem value="docker-cli" label="Docker CLI">

Add the following to your `docker run` command:
```bash
-e "FORCE_IPV4_FIRST=true"
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">

Add the following to your `compose.yaml`:
```yaml
---
services:
  jellyseerr:
    environment:
      - FORCE_IPV4_FIRST=true
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Option 3: Check that your server can reach TMDB API

Make sure that your server can reach the TMDB API by running the following command:

<Tabs groupId="methods" queryString>
  <TabItem value="docker-cli" label="Docker CLI">

```bash
docker exec -it jellyseerr sh -c "apk update && apk add curl && curl -L https://api.themoviedb.org"
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">

```bash
docker compose exec jellyseerr sh -c "apk update && apk add curl && curl -L https://api.themoviedb.org"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

In a terminal:
```bash
curl -L https://api.themoviedb.org
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

In a PowerShell window:
```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://api.themoviedb.org" -Method Get).Content
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

If you can't get a response, then your server can't reach the TMDB API.
This is usually due to a network configuration issue or a firewall blocking the connection.
