# Introduction

Welcome to the Jellyseerr Documentation.

**Jellyseerr** is a free and open source software application for managing requests for your media library. It integrates with the media server of your choice: [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org), [Plex](https://plex.tv), and [Emby](https://emby.media/). In addition, it integrates with your existing services, such as **[Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/)**, **[Radarr](https://radarr.video/)**.

## Motivation

The primary motivation for starting Jellyseerr was to bring Jellyfin and Emby support to Overseerr. However, over time, **Jellyseerr** has evolved into its own distinct application with unique features. Designed as a one-stop shop for media requests, it offers a simple, easy-to-use experience for managing requests on Jellyfin, Emby, and Plex servers.

## We need your help!

[Jellyseerr](https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr) is an ambitious project where developers/contributors poured a lot of work into, and that builds on top of [Overseerr](https://github.com/sct/overseerr). And we have a lot more to do as well.

We value your feedback and support in identifying and fixing bugs to make Jellyseerr even better. As an open-source project, we welcome contributions from everyone. While Jellyseerr has diverged from Overseerr and evolved into its own unique application, we still encourage contributions to Overseerr, as it played a crucial role in inspiring what Jellyseerr has become today.

Contribution includes building new features, patching bugs, translating the application, or even just writing documentation.

If you would like to contribute, please be sure to review our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/fallenbagel/jellyseerr/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).
