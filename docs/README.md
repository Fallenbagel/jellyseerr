## Motivation

The primary motivation for starting this project was to add support for Jellyfin and Emby to Overseerr. As Overseerr is an incredibly performant and easy-to-use application, we wanted to bring that same experience to Jellyfin and Emby users. Thus, **Jellyseerr** was born.

This application is designed to be a **one-stop-shop** for all your media requests. It is designed to be a **simple, easy-to-use** application that allows users to request media to be added to your Jellyfin/Emby/Plex server.

## We need your help!

[Jellyseerr](https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr) is a fork of Overseerr, with a heavy focus on Jellyfin and Emby integration.
[Overseerr](https://github.com/sct/overseerr) is an ambitious project where the original developers/contributors have already poured a lot of work into, and we wanted to build on top of that.

We also have poured a lot of work into this project, and we have a lot more to do as well. We need your valuable feedback and help to find and fix bugs. Also, with Jellyseerr being an open-source project, anyone is welcome to contribute. We also encourage you to contribute to Overseerr as well.

Contribution includes building new features, patching bugs, translating the application, or even just writing documentation.

If you would like to contribute, please be sure to review our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/fallenbagel/jellyseerr/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).
