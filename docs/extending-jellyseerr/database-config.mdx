# Configuring the Database

Jellyseerr supports SQLite and PostgreSQL. The database connection can be configured using the following environment variables:

## SQLite Options

```dotenv
DB_TYPE="sqlite" # Which DB engine to use, either "sqlite" or "postgres". The default is "sqlite".
CONFIG_DIRECTORY="config" # (optional) The path to the config directory where the db file is stored. The default is "config".
DB_LOG_QUERIES="false" # (optional) Whether to log the DB queries for debugging. The default is "false".
```

## PostgreSQL Options

```dotenv
DB_TYPE="postgres" # Which DB engine to use, either "sqlite" or "postgres". The default is "sqlite". To use postgres, this needs to be set to "postgres"
DB_HOST="localhost" # (optional) The host (url) of the database. The default is "localhost".
DB_PORT="5432" # (optional) The port to connect to. The default is "5432".
DB_USER= # (required) Username used to connect to the database
DB_PASS= # (required) Password of the user used to connect to the database
DB_NAME="jellyseerr" # (optional) The name of the database to connect to. The default is "jellyseerr".
DB_LOG_QUERIES="false" # (optional) Whether to log the DB queries for debugging. The default is "false".
```

### SSL configuration
The following options can be used to further configure ssl. Certificates can be provided as a string or a file path, with the string version taking precedence.

```dotenv
DB_USE_SSL="false" # (optional) Whether to enable ssl for database connection. This must be "true" to use the other ssl options. The default is "false".
DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED="true" # (optional) Whether to reject ssl connections with unverifiable certificates i.e. self-signed certificates without providing the below settings. The default is "true".
DB_SSL_CA= # (optional) The CA certificate to verify the connection, provided as a string. The default is "".
DB_SSL_CA_FILE= # (optional) The path to a CA certificate to verify the connection. The default is "".
DB_SSL_KEY= # (optional) The private key for the connection in PEM format, provided as a string. The default is "".
DB_SSL_KEY_FILE= # (optinal) Path to the private key for the connection in PEM format. The default is "".
DB_SSL_CERT= # (optional) Certificate chain in pem format for the private key, provided as a string. The default is "".
DB_SSL_CERT_FILE= # (optional) Path to certificate chain in pem format for the private key. The default is "".
```

### Migrating from SQLite to PostgreSQL

1. Set up your PostgreSQL database and configure Jellyseerr to use it
2. Run Jellyseerr to create the tables in the PostgreSQL database
3. Stop Jellyseerr
4. Run the following command to export the data from the SQLite database and import it into the PostgreSQL database:
- Edit the postgres connection string to match your setup
- WARNING: The most recent release of pgloader has an issue quoting the table columns. Use the version in the docker container to avoid this issue.
- "I don't have or don't want to use docker" - You can build the working pgloader version [in this PR](https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader/pull/1531) from source and use the same options as below.
```bash
docker run --rm -v config/db.sqlite3:/db.sqlite3:ro -v pgloader/pgloader.load:/pgloader.load ghcr.io/ralgar/pgloader:pr-1531 pgloader --with "quote identifiers" --with "data only" /db.sqlite3 postgresql://{{DB_USER}}:{{DB_PASS}}@{{DB_HOST}}:{{DB_PORT}}/{{DB_NAME}}
   ```
5. Start Jellyseerr
