# Notifications

## Supported Notification Agents

Jellyseerr currently supports the following notification agents:

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />

## Setting Up Notifications

Simply configure your desired notification agents in **Settings -> Notifications** in the Jellyseerr web UI.

Users can customize their notification preferences in their own user notification settings.

## Requesting New Notification Agents

If we do not currently support your preferred notification agent, feel free to [submit a feature request on GitHub](https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr/issues). However, please be sure to search first and confirm that there is not already an existing request for the agent!
